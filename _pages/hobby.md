I minored in Critical Film Prodcution at UIUC's College of Media. 

Here is the work I presented at UIUC's 2023 Undergraduate Research Symposium: [Howl's Moving Castle Moving](https://youtu.be/StPev5OnTlI). This project was advised by [Dr. OK](http://jennyok.com/).

I am a part time photographer. I take portraits, and I enjoy doing astro. Here is my photography portfolio: [Poo Photography](https://sites.google.com/view/poophotography/portrait-portfolio%E5%AE%A2%E5%8D%95%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA)
You can also see my work being displayed on the big screen located at the lobby of Siebel School of Computing and Data Science (40°6′50.06″N 88°13′29.20″W/40.1139056°N 88.2247778°W).
They are also permently up on their social media(instagram): [illinoiscds](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-BdTQrSE2Q/?img_index=1).

I do art with different media. Recently I have been working more with watercolors. I am a flute player and a thrift shop lover. 

I also enjoy playing Riichi Mahjong(AKA Japanese Mahjong), it is the most complex type of mahjong, where players play more defensively because the penalty of dealing in anthor player is high. Here is more info: [Riichi Wiki](https://riichi.wiki/Majsoul)
