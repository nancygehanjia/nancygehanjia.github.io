I am Minoring in Critical Film Prodcution at UIUC. 

Here is the work I presented at UIUC's 2023 Undergraduate Research Symposium. [Howl's Moving Castle Moving](https://youtu.be/StPev5OnTlI). This project is advised by [Dr. OK](http://jennyok.com/).

I am a part time photographer. I take portrays, and I enjoy doing astro. Here is my photography portfolio: [Poo Photography](https://sites.google.com/view/poophotography/portrait-portfolio%E5%AE%A2%E5%8D%95%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA)

I love playing Japanese Mahjong.
